            <q>The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill; the willingness to learn is a choice.</q><br><i>- by Brian Herbert.</i>
            <p>
                Learning is a constant journey which is probably the endless one. My learning journey of web development
                started with my first college project. I started with the most basic but important language in web
                development which is HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. This language serves as the
                structure of a website, it helps in making the basic backbone.<br><br>
                Then we have another important language, CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This is a
                stylesheet language that decides how the website will look on the web browser to the users. It helps in
                styling the HTML elements and making the website more beautiful in an overall view.<br><br>
                The last for today, we have JavaScript. This serves as a script that helps us in performing various
                actions on a website and thus making the website interactive.<br>
                These 3 languages are the required ones which are enough for building wonderful websites. These were my
                learning's introduction in brief form. You can explore more on by OYO(On Your Own) but keep in mind don't
                get worried, scared or overwhelmed and give up; Instead, keep exploring and try to make things simple &
                interesting.ðŸ˜‰<br><br>
                These learnings will be more explained in my upcoming blogs. <br>
                Keep Smiling and Be happy!!ðŸ˜Š
