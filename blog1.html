                <q>The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.</q><br><i>- by Tony Robbins</i>
            <p>
                I wonder how people make these beautiful-looking and useful websites with those perfect amount of colors, stylish fonts, cute images, and what not. I know everyone wonders this when they start building interest in web development.<br><br>
                I honestly started it all from my college mini project where I and my team members said, " let's make a website"(but frankly at that time, I didn't even know how to start ðŸ˜Œ). I was a bit worried at first because just by seeing the code the first thought that came to my mind was "What is this and how does one understand this? But then I slowly started understanding it and then with a bit help from Google found this wonderful world of web development.<br><br>
                Web development for me is like preparing a one-stop-shop where whatever user needs are should be fulfilled in an interesting, smooth, and efficient way. It's a wonderland for those who explore it for the first time. For me, it is an experience of "Alice in Wonderland".<br><br>
                I am learning web development now from neoG.camp's level zero program through their YouTube videos where the mentor is Tanay Pratap sir. This neoG.camp is totally beginner-friendly, their goal is to teach students right from scratch till the job ready state. For those who are looking for a program to ace web development, neoG.camp is a one-stop-shop. âœŒ<br><br>
                My Journey has already begun ðŸ’• <br>
                When are YOU starting?
